## Build Status
**Keep in mind that the Build Status only shows the outcome of linting your code; therefore, it takes one to two minutes in order to update. In GitHub, clicking the "Commits" tab (next to the "Branches" and "Releases" tab) is better since you can see as it's building (a yellow dot for building, a green check for a successful build, and a red "X" for a failed build).**

|**Branch**|**Build Status**|
|:---------|:--------------:|
|*[master](https://github.com/RockvilleRobotics/Incredibots2019/tree/master)*|[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/RockvilleRobotics/Incredibots2019.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/RockvilleRobotics/Incredibots2019)|

Click the button if you would like more information; Click "Sign in with GitHub" and authorize your account and then press the button once again. **Keep in mind that, if you want to see your Build Status, you'll have to manually navigate, in the Travis CI interface, to the "Running" tab if you just made a commit or to the "Branches" tab if you previously made a commit.**
